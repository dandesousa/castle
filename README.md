# castle

This is my homesick compatible repository, storage space for all my associated dotfiles.

## Installation 

The easiest way to install is to ensure you have git and zsh provisioned on your machine and run:

```
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandesousa/castle/master/setup.sh)"
```

## Credits

Inspired by and happily using oh-my-zsh.

Special thanks goes to [fsproru / vimfiles](https://github.com/fsproru/vimfiles) who provided examples for solving my vim / vundle problem.

Also to [gmarik / vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for an amazing tool.
